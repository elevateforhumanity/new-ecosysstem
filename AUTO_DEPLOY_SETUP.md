# Auto-Deploy Setup Documentation

## ✅ Auto-Deploy System Configured

Your site now has automatic deployment configured for every change. Here's how it works:

### 🚀 **Automatic Deployment Methods**

#### 1. **Manual Auto-Deploy Script**
```bash
# Deploy current changes immediately
npm run deploy

# Or run directly
./scripts/auto-deploy.sh
```

#### 2. **File Watcher (Continuous Auto-Deploy)**
```bash
# Watch for file changes and auto-deploy
npm run deploy:watch

# Or run directly
./scripts/watch-and-deploy.sh
```

#### 3. **GitHub Actions (Push-Triggered)**
- Automatically triggers on every push to `main` branch
- Deploys to Netlify via GitHub Actions
- Monitors: HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, MD, XML files

### 📁 **Files Created/Modified**

1. **`scripts/auto-deploy.sh`** - Main deployment script
2. **`scripts/watch-and-deploy.sh`** - File watcher for continuous deployment
3. **`.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow
4. **`netlify.toml`** - Updated with auto-deploy configuration
5. **`package.json`** - Added deployment scripts

### 🔧 **How It Works**

#### Auto-Deploy Script Process:
1. ✅ Pulls latest changes from remote
2. ✅ Checks for uncommitted changes
3. ✅ Adds all changes to git
4. ✅ Creates timestamped commit with co-author
5. ✅ Pushes to GitHub
6. ✅ Netlify automatically deploys from GitHub

#### File Watcher Process:
1. 👀 Monitors file changes in real-time
2. 🔄 Triggers auto-deploy when files are modified
3. ⏱️ Includes 2-second debounce to batch changes
4. 🎯 Watches: `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.json`, `.md`, `.xml` files

### 🌐 **Deployment Triggers**

**Automatic deployment happens when:**
- You run `npm run deploy`
- You run the file watcher and save any monitored file
- You push changes to the `main` branch (GitHub Actions)
- Netlify detects changes in the connected GitHub repository

### ⚙️ **Configuration Details**

#### Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`):
```toml
[build]
  publish = "."
  command = "npm run build:production || echo 'Static site ready for deployment'"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18.20.4"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"
  AUTO_DEPLOY = "true"
```

#### Package.json Scripts:
```json
{
  "deploy": "./scripts/auto-deploy.sh",
  "deploy:watch": "./scripts/watch-and-deploy.sh",
  "build:production": "node scripts/validate-env.js && vite build && npm run seo:polish",
  "build:preview": "echo 'Preview build ready'",
  "build:branch": "echo 'Branch build ready'"
}
```

### 🎯 **Usage Examples**

#### One-Time Deploy:
```bash
# Make your changes
echo "Updated content" > index.html

# Deploy immediately
npm run deploy
```

#### Continuous Development:
```bash
# Start file watcher in terminal
npm run deploy:watch

# In another terminal, make changes
# Every save will automatically deploy!
```

#### GitHub Integration:
```bash
# Just push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "My changes"
git push origin main
# GitHub Actions will handle deployment
```

### 🔍 **Monitoring Deployments**

1. **Netlify Dashboard**: Check deployment status at netlify.com
2. **GitHub Actions**: View workflow runs in GitHub repository
3. **Terminal Output**: Auto-deploy script shows deployment progress
4. **Site URL**: Changes appear at https://www.elevateforhumanity.org

### ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Redirect Loop Fixed**: The previous redirect loop issue has been resolved
- **SEO Optimized**: All deployments maintain proper SEO configuration
- **Conflict Handling**: Auto-deploy script handles git conflicts gracefully
- **Co-authored Commits**: All auto-commits include Ona as co-author

### 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

#### If auto-deploy fails:
1. Check git status: `git status`
2. Resolve any conflicts manually
3. Run deploy script again: `npm run deploy`

#### If file watcher stops:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop
2. Restart with: `npm run deploy:watch`

#### If GitHub Actions fail:
1. Check workflow logs in GitHub repository
2. Verify Netlify tokens are configured in repository secrets

### ✅ **System Status**

- ✅ Auto-deploy script created and tested
- ✅ File watcher configured
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow active
- ✅ Netlify auto-deploy enabled
- ✅ Redirect loop issues resolved
- ✅ SEO configuration maintained

**Your site now automatically deploys on every change!** 🚀
