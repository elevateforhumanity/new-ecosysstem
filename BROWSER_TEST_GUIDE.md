# 🧪 BROWSER TEST FOR WWW SUBDOMAIN

## 🔍 **MANUAL BROWSER TEST**

Since you're currently on the site, please test the www subdomain:

### **Test 1: Direct WWW Access**
1. **Open new tab**
2. **Go to**: `https://www.elevateforhumanity.org`
3. **Check**: Does it load or show SSL error?

### **Test 2: HTTP vs HTTPS**
1. **Try**: `http://www.elevateforhumanity.org` (without SSL)
2. **Check**: Does it redirect to https://elevateforhumanity.org?

## 📊 **POSSIBLE RESULTS**

### **If you get SSL error in browser:**
- ❌ Confirms SSL certificate not provisioned for www
- 🎯 Need to add www as custom domain in Netlify

### **If it redirects successfully:**
- ✅ Configuration is working
- 🤔 CLI test might be using different SSL validation

### **If it loads www site directly:**
- ⚠️ Redirect not working properly
- 🎯 Need to configure redirect in Netlify

## 🔧 **NEXT STEPS BASED ON RESULT**

### **If SSL Error:**
```
Go to Netlify Dashboard:
Site settings → Domain management → Add custom domain
Enter: www.elevateforhumanity.org
Choose: Redirect to primary domain
```

### **If Working:**
```
The issue might be CLI-specific
Your site visitors can access both domains properly
```

## 🧪 **PLEASE TEST AND REPORT:**
1. What happens when you visit `https://www.elevateforhumanity.org`?
