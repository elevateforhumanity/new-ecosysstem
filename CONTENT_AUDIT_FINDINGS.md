## 🎯 **CONTENT STRATEGY REALIGNMENT**

### **IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:**

#### 1. **Homepage Identity Crisis**
**Current:** "Transform Your Career with AI & Data Science" + $1,997-$4,950 pricing
**Should Be:** "WIOA-Approved Workforce Development" + "No-cost federal funding available"

#### 2. **Programs Page Mismatch**
**Current:** Consumer tech bootcamps with pricing
**Should Be:** Government-approved workforce programs with funding options

#### 3. **Missing Critical Pages**
- Veterans services (mentioned in audit, missing in code)
- Government contracting details
- WIOA-specific intake process
- Funding eligibility and processes

#### 4. **Tone & Messaging**
**Current:** "Join thousands who've launched high-paying tech careers"
**Should Be:** "State-verified training programs with job placement assistance"
