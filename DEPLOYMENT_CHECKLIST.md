## ðŸ“¦ Production Deploy: S3 + CloudFront (Drop-in)

This repo includes a single deploy script that builds the site, generates `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`, uploads only `dist/` to S3 with correct cache headers, and triggers a CloudFront invalidation.

### Prereqs
- AWS CLI installed and authenticated: `aws configure`
- Node 18.x recommended (script warns if different)

### Quick Start
1) Edit variables at the top of `deploy.sh`:
	 - `AWS_S3_BUCKET`, `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`, `SITE_URL`
2) Run a deploy:
	 - `npm run deploy`
	 - Optional: verify after deploy with one command
		 - `VERIFY_AFTER_DEPLOY=true SITE_URL="https://your-domain" npm run deploy`

### What the script does
- `npm ci` (or `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`) + `npm run build`
- Creates `dist/robots.txt` and `dist/sitemap.xml`
- Uploads HTML with `no-cache` and assets with long cache (`max-age=31536000, immutable`)
- Sets correct content-types for `robots.txt` (text/plain) and `sitemap.xml` (application/xml)
- CloudFront invalidation on `/*`

### Optional: HLS video upload
Set `ENABLE_HLS_UPLOAD=true` to upload HLS assets with correct headers:
- Copy step: `HLS_SOURCE_DIR` (default `public/hls`) âžœ `HLS_LOCAL_DIR` (default `dist/hls`)
- Upload rules:
	- Playlists `*.m3u8`: `application/vnd.apple.mpegurl`, `no-cache`
	- Segments `*.ts, *.m4s, *.mp4, *.webm`: long cache
- CloudFront invalidation limited to `HLS_INVALIDATION_PATHS` (default `/hls/*`)
- Variables:
	- `ENABLE_HLS_UPLOAD=true`
	- `HLS_SOURCE_DIR=public/hls`
	- `HLS_LOCAL_DIR=dist/hls`
	- `HLS_S3_BUCKET` (defaults to site bucket)
	- `HLS_PREFIX=hls`
	- `HLS_INVALIDATION_PATHS=/hls/*`

Example:

```bash
ENABLE_HLS_UPLOAD=true \
SITE_URL="https://www.example.com" \
VERIFY_AFTER_DEPLOY=true \
npm run deploy
```

Sample HLS layout provided in `public/hls/sample/`.

### Post-deploy verification (recommended)
- Standalone: `SITE_URL="https://www.example.com" npm run verify:deploy`
- Part of deploy: set `VERIFY_AFTER_DEPLOY=true`
- Script: `scripts/verify-deploy.mjs` collects URLs from `dist` (+ robots/sitemap) and probes them via HEAD/GET with concurrency, timeouts, and retries. It exits non-zero if any URL fails.

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure `aws configure` is completed and the IAM user/role can read/write S3 and create CloudFront invalidations.
- If npm gets stuck (idealTree), clean cache and reinstall in the project directory (not `/`).
