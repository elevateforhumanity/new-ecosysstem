# 🎯 EXACT NETLIFY FIX NEEDED

## 🔍 **CURRENT STATUS**
- ✅ DNS record exists: `www.elevateforhumanity.org → elevateforhumanity.netlify.app`
- ❌ SSL still failing: Certificate not provisioned for www
- 🎯 **Missing**: www subdomain as custom domain on your site

## 🚨 **THE ISSUE**
You have the DNS record but **www is not added as a custom domain** to your Netlify site. The DNS record alone doesn't provision SSL certificates.

## 🎯 **EXACT FIX NEEDED**

### **Go to your Netlify site (not DNS settings):**

1. **Navigate to**: https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_SITE_NAME/settings/domain
2. **Look for**: "Custom domains" section (not DNS settings)
3. **Click**: "Add custom domain"
4. **Enter**: `www.elevateforhumanity.org`
5. **Click**: "Verify" then "Add domain"
6. **Choose**: "Redirect to primary domain" (recommended)

### **Alternative path:**
1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com/
2. **Click**: Your site name (elevateforhumanity.org)
3. **Click**: "Site settings" (top menu)
4. **Click**: "Domain management" (left sidebar)
5. **Scroll to**: "Custom domains" section
6. **Click**: "Add custom domain"

## 🔒 **WHAT THIS DOES**
- ✅ Provisions SSL certificate for www subdomain
- ✅ Enables HTTPS for www.elevateforhumanity.org
- ✅ Activates your redirect rules from netlify.toml
- ✅ Resolves SSL handshake failure

## ⏰ **TIMING**
- SSL certificate provisions in 2-5 minutes
- Redirect becomes active immediately
- Issue completely resolved

## 🧪 **VERIFICATION**
After adding the custom domain:
```bash
curl -I https://www.elevateforhumanity.org
# Should return: HTTP/2 301 location: https://elevateforhumanity.org/
```

## 📋 **KEY DIFFERENCE**
- ❌ DNS record = Routes traffic but no SSL
- ✅ Custom domain = Routes traffic + SSL certificate + redirects

**You need to add www as a CUSTOM DOMAIN, not just a DNS record!**
