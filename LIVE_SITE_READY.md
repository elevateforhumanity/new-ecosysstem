## ðŸ”§ Environment Issues Fix

The stream events error you're seeing is a development environment connectivity issue. It doesn't affect your deployed sites, only the preview functionality here.

**Your sites will work perfectly once deployed to:**
- GitHub Pages
- CloudFlare Pages  
- Netlify
- Any hosting platform

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Next Step

**Try GitHub Pages first:** https://elevateforhumanity.github.io/new-ecosysstem/

If that's not working, use CloudFlare Pages manual setup - it's the most reliable option for your government contracting needs.
