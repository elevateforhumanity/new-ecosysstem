# 🌐 NETLIFY SSL FIX

## 🎯 THE REAL ISSUE

Your domain is hosted on **Netlify**, not Cloudflare! That's why the Cloudflare API tokens don't work.

## 🚀 NETLIFY SSL FIX

### 1. Login to Netlify
```
https://app.netlify.com/
```

### 2. Go to Your Site
Find and click your `elevateforhumanity.org` site

### 3. Fix Domain Settings
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Add: `www.elevateforhumanity.org`
4. Choose: **"Redirect to primary domain"** (recommended)

### 4. Enable HTTPS
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Domain management** → **HTTPS**
2. Make sure **"Force HTTPS"** is enabled
3. Verify SSL certificate covers both domains

### 5. Alternative: DNS Redirect
If you want to handle it at DNS level:
1. Go to your DNS provider
2. Add CNAME record: `www` → `elevateforhumanity.org`
3. Or add redirect rule: `www.elevateforhumanity.org` → `https://elevateforhumanity.org`

## 🤔 WHY CLOUDFLARE DIDN'T WORK

Your domain isn't managed by Cloudflare - it's on Netlify. The API tokens were valid, but there are no zones in your Cloudflare account because the domain is hosted elsewhere.

**Fix it in Netlify, not Cloudflare!**
