# ðŸ”§ Redirect Loop Fix Applied

## Problem Identified
Your site was experiencing `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` due to conflicting redirect rules between Cloudflare and your `_redirects` file.

## Root Cause
```
Original _redirects file had:
1. https://elevateforhumanity.org/* â†’ https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/:splat (301)
2. http://www.elevateforhumanity.org/* â†’ https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/:splat (301)
```

**The Conflict:**
- Cloudflare "Always Use HTTPS" automatically converts HTTP â†’ HTTPS
- Your rule #2 was also trying to convert HTTP â†’ HTTPS
- This created a redirect loop when both systems tried to handle HTTPS enforcement

## Fix Applied
âœ… **Removed the HTTP â†’ HTTPS redirect rule** from `_redirects`
âœ… **Kept the non-www â†’ www redirect** for SEO consistency
âœ… **Let Cloudflare handle HTTPS enforcement** (more efficient)

## Current _redirects Configuration
```
# Pass static assets straight through
/assets/*  /assets/:splat  200

# Redirect non-www to www (primary domain for SEO)
https://elevateforhumanity.org/* https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/:splat 301!

# Note: HTTPS redirect removed - Cloudflare handles HTTP->HTTPS automatically
# Keeping this would create a redirect loop with Cloudflare's "Always Use HTTPS"

# Student portal clean URLs
/student-portal /student-portal.html 200
/enroll /student-portal.html 200
/login /student-portal.html 200
/certificates /student-portal.html 200

# SPA fallback
/*          /index.html     200
```

## Expected Behavior Now
- âœ… `http://elevateforhumanity.org` â†’ Cloudflare â†’ `https://www.elevateforhumanity.org`
- âœ… `https://elevateforhumanity.org` â†’ `https://www.elevateforhumanity.org`
- âœ… `http://www.elevateforhumanity.org` â†’ Cloudflare â†’ `https://www.elevateforhumanity.org`
- âœ… `https://www.elevateforhumanity.org` â†’ No redirect (final destination)

## Next Steps
1. Deploy this change to your hosting platform
2. Clear browser cache or test in incognito mode
3. Verify the site loads without redirect loops

## Cloudflare Settings Recommendation
Ensure your Cloudflare SSL/TLS mode is set to:
- **"Full"** or **"Full (Strict)"** (not "Flexible")
- **"Always Use HTTPS"** can remain enabled
