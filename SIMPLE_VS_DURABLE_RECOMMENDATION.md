# Simple vs Durable: Domain Strategy Recommendation

## Your Current Situation
- **elevateforhumanity.org** → Currently on Cloudflare/Netlify (working)
- **elevate4humanity.org** → Currently on Wix (404 but connected)
- You want to point **www.elevateforhumanity.org** to Wix

## Option 1: Simple Approach (Quick Fix)
**Just point www.elevateforhumanity.org to Wix**

### Pros:
- ✅ **Fast** - Can be done in 30 minutes
- ✅ **Simple** - No complex redirects
- ✅ **Low risk** - Minimal changes

### Cons:
- ❌ **Brand confusion** - Two different domains serving different content
- ❌ **SEO split** - Search authority divided between domains
- ❌ **User confusion** - People won't know which domain to use
- ❌ **Maintenance overhead** - Managing two separate sites
- ❌ **Analytics mess** - Traffic split across domains

### Implementation:
```
In Cloudflare for elevateforhumanity.org:
1. Change www CNAME to point to Wix
2. Done
```

## Option 2: Durable Approach (RECOMMENDED)
**Consolidate everything under one primary domain**

### Pros:
- ✅ **Professional** - One clear brand identity
- ✅ **SEO optimized** - All authority flows to one domain
- ✅ **User-friendly** - No confusion about which domain to use
- ✅ **Future-proof** - Scales as you grow
- ✅ **Analytics clarity** - All traffic in one place
- ✅ **Easier maintenance** - One primary domain to manage

### Cons:
- ⚠️ **Takes longer** - 2-3 hours to implement properly
- ⚠️ **Requires planning** - Need to think through the architecture

## My Strong Recommendation: **GO DURABLE**

Here's why:

### 1. **You're Early Enough**
Since you're still setting up, now is the perfect time to do it right. Fixing this later will be much harder.

### 2. **Professional Image**
Having one clear domain makes you look more established and trustworthy.

### 3. **SEO Benefits**
Google will see one strong domain instead of two weak ones.

### 4. **User Experience**
People will remember one domain, not get confused about which one to use.

## Recommended Quick Durable Setup

### Choose Primary Domain: **elevate4humanity.org** (shorter, cleaner)

### 30-Minute Implementation:
```
1. In Wix: Connect elevate4humanity.org as primary domain
2. In Cloudflare: Set up redirects from elevateforhumanity.org → elevate4humanity.org
3. Update your app configs to use elevate4humanity.org
4. Done!
```

### Result:
- **elevate4humanity.org** → Wix (main site)
- **www.elevate4humanity.org** → Wix (main site)
- **elevateforhumanity.org** → 301 redirect to elevate4humanity.org
- **www.elevateforhumanity.org** → 301 redirect to www.elevate4humanity.org
- **app.elevate4humanity.org** → Your Netlify app

## Bottom Line

**Don't just point www.elevateforhumanity.org to Wix.** 

**Instead, spend 30 more minutes and set up the durable solution.** You'll thank yourself later when:
- Your SEO is stronger
- Your brand is clearer  
- Your users aren't confused
- Your analytics are clean

The durable approach is only slightly more work but gives you 10x the benefits.
