Awesome. Here’s the Durable-specific DNS you can use alongside Vercel and R2.

1) Grab Durable’s DNS target

In the Durable dashboard → your site → Custom Domain:

You’ll see a CNAME target that looks like:
your-site-12345.durable.co  (the exact value comes from Durable)


Copy that target; I’ll call it DURABLE_TARGET below.


---

2) Pick your layout

Option A — Durable at root, Vercel at app

Most marketing sites do this.

Records to create at your DNS host (GoDaddy/Namecheap/Cloudflare, etc.):

Hostname	Type	Value	Notes

@ (root)	ALIAS/ANAME (or flattened CNAME*)	DURABLE_TARGET	If your DNS doesn’t support ALIAS/ANAME at root, use Cloudflare DNS (CNAME flattening “On”).
www	CNAME	DURABLE_TARGET	Redirects www to Durable (Durable can auto-redirect to root).
app	CNAME	cname.vercel-dns.com	Your Vercel app lives at app.yourdomain.com.


* If your registrar only allows A at root and no ALIAS/CNAME flattening, you can keep root on Vercel (Option B) and put Durable on www.


---

Option B — Vercel at root, Durable at www

Good if your app is the main experience.

Hostname	Type	Value

@ (root)	A	76.76.21.21 (Vercel’s root A)
www	CNAME	DURABLE_TARGET
app (optional)	CNAME	cname.vercel-dns.com


In Vercel → Project → Domains, set root as Primary (so www can redirect, if you prefer).


---

3) Verification & SSL

Add the records, then in Durable click Verify for the domain you attached there.

In Vercel, go to Project → Domains → Verify; Vercel will issue SSL automatically once DNS is correct.

Propagation usually takes a few minutes (can be longer at some registrars).



---

4) Quick “copy block” (fill in your target)

Replace DURABLE_TARGET with the exact CNAME Durable shows.

Option A (Durable root, Vercel app)

Host: @      Type: ALIAS/ANAME (or CNAME flattening)  Value: DURABLE_TARGET
Host: www    Type: CNAME                               Value: DURABLE_TARGET
Host: app    Type: CNAME                               Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Option B (Vercel root, Durable www)

Host: @      Type: A       Value: 76.76.21.21
Host: www    Type: CNAME   Value: DURABLE_TARGET
Host: app    Type: CNAME   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com   (optional)


---

5) Tie-in with your script

Nothing extra is needed in the migration script. After it pushes code to GitHub and deploys Vercel, just add the DNS above and:

In Durable: set Primary/redirects as you like (root ↔ www).

In Vercel: mark your Primary domain (root or app) in Project → Domains.


If you paste your exact Durable CNAME target and tell me which layout you want (A or B), I’ll reply with your final, concrete records ready to enter at your registrar.
