Nice—thanks for pasting the hardened server.mjs. That file looks good. If your server still “stops loading,” run through this short, surgical checklist:

1) Install the needed deps (root)

npm i express compression helmet morgan

2) Make sure Replit builds the client before serving

.replit (root):

run = "bash -lc 'cd client && npm run quick && cd .. && npm run start'"

3) Client build present?

If client/dist is missing, you’ll get a blank. Force a clean build:

cd client
npm run clean
cd ..
npm run start

4) Set your admin secret

Add ADMIN_TOKEN in Replit Secrets (any strong string). This powers:

POST /_restart (from your React /debug page)

POST /_purge   (cache-bust)


5) Sanity checks

Open /health → should show { status: "healthy", ready: true, … }

Open /debug (React page) → Tailwind badge green (OK), cache badge shows cache v… · quick

Replit console → should log:

EFH server running on http://localhost:5000 | mode=quick

and request logs from morgan.

If it still “stops loading,” try these quick fixes

Node version on Replit: ensure a modern Node. replit.nix (root):

{ pkgs }: {
  deps = [
    pkgs.nodejs_20
    pkgs.nodePackages.npm
  ];
}

Port mismatch: Replit exposes the port it assigns. Our code uses process.env.PORT || 5000 — that’s fine. Don’t hardcode another port.

Missing dist: If /health shows "ready": false, the build didn’t run or failed. Re-run npm run clean in client/ and check console errors (usually Tailwind/PostCSS misconfig).

Long/slow requests: We already set generous timeouts:

keepAliveTimeout = 60s

headersTimeout  = 65s

requestTimeout  = 60s If you still see timeouts, reduce big API calls or add pagination.


Crashes: If you see an exception just before it dies, paste it here. We already catch unhandledRejection and uncaughtException to avoid dying, but some fatal errors (like platform restarts) are outside Node. Use the Restart Server button on /debug to bounce it cleanly.

Optional: tiny watchdog (logs a heartbeat)

Drop this near the bottom of server.mjs (below server.listen) to confirm it’s alive every 30s:

setInterval(() => {
  console.log(`[heartbeat] up ${Math.round(process.uptime())}s | mode=${BUILD_MODE} | cache=${CACHE_VERSION}`);
}, 30_000).unref();

If you hit another stall, tell me exactly what /health returns and what the last 5–10 lines in the Replit console say. I’ll zero in on the cause and patch it.
