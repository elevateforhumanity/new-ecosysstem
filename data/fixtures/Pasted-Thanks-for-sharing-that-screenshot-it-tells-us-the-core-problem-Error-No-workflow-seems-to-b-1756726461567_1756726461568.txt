Thanks for sharing that screenshot — it tells us the core problem:

> “Error: No workflow seems to be running at the moment”
…and later it says “I can see the server process isn’t running”.



That means the Node process for server.mjs isn’t being started, or it’s crashing immediately. On Replit, when the workflow isn’t alive, the agent can’t curl localhost.

Steps to get it stable

1. Check your .replit run command

Open your .replit file at the project root. Make sure it has a run line like:

run = "npm run start"

…and in your root package.json, confirm you have:

"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.mjs"
}

That guarantees Replit launches your hardened server, not just the client build.


---

2. Don’t kill the process yourself

In your logs it shows the agent tried:

pkill -f "node.*server"

That’s fine for restarting, but on Replit you normally just rely on .replit to keep it alive. If you kill it manually, the agent sees “no workflow running.”


---

3. Add a safe fallback (so it won’t die on missing dist)

If the crash happens because client/dist/index.html isn’t there, patch the Static assets & SPA fallback in server.mjs:

app.get("*", (_req, res) => {
  const indexFile = path.join(distPath, "index.html");
  if (fs.existsSync(indexFile)) {
    return res.sendFile(indexFile);
  }
  // fallback HTML
  res.status(200).type("html").send(`
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head><title>EFH server alive</title></head>
      <body>
        <h1>EFH server is running</h1>
        <p>No client build found. Run:</p>
        <pre>cd client && npm run clean && cd .. && npm run start</pre>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);
});

Now it never exits just because the build folder isn’t ready.


---

4. Sanity test

Run this in the Replit shell:

npm run start

You should see:

EFH server running on http://localhost:5000 | mode=quick

Then hit:

curl -s http://localhost:5000/health

You should get JSON with status: "healthy".


---

⚡️ If you still see it “stop” — paste me the last 10 lines of the console log after npm run start. That will show exactly why the process exits (uncaught error, missing module, port conflict, etc.), and I’ll patch it so it never auto-stops.

👉 Do you want me to give you a minimal .replit + package.json snippet you can drop in right now so we know Replit is definitely launching server.mjs?
