Thanks for sharing the screenshot — it helps a lot.

The agent log is telling us the exact cause:

> “Your project has both static HTML files (in root) AND a React app (in client/), and I just configured the server to serve the static HTML files.”



That explains the blank page:

What’s Happening

The server is serving the plain static HTML in the root (probably an empty or placeholder index.html).

Your actual React/Vite app is inside client/, but the server isn’t building or serving that — so the browser just shows a blank/static file.


How to Fix It

You need to make sure your deployment is actually serving the React app build, not the raw static root.

Option 1 – Move app to root (simplest)

1. Delete or move any old index.html files sitting in the project root (outside client/).


2. Move everything from client/ into the root of the project (so src/, package.json, etc. are at the top level).


3. Run a clean build:

rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build


4. Make your server (or Replit run command) serve dist/.

Option 2 – Update server to serve client/dist If you want to keep the client/ folder:

1. In your server file (often index.js, server.js, or your Replit entry), change it to serve the React build:

import express from "express";
import path from "path";

const app = express();
const distPath = path.join(process.cwd(), "client", "dist");

app.use(express.static(distPath));

// SPA fallback
app.get("*", (_req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(distPath, "index.html"));
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running...");
});


2. Make sure your build command is:

cd client && npm install && npm run build

and that your Replit run command starts the above server.

Option 3 – Clean up hybrid setup If you don’t actually want static HTML at all (just React):

Delete or archive the extra HTML files.

Keep only the React app.

Re-deploy with the correct build + server setup.



---

✅ Once you do this, the site will stop serving the blank static HTML and instead render your React/Vite build correctly.

Would you like me to write you a ready-to-paste Replit replit.nix + run script that builds client/ and serves the React app automatically? That way you don’t have to keep adjusting manually.
