## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with Vite for fast development and build processes.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- **Routing**: React Router for managing application routes.
- **State Management**: Context API or other state management libraries as needed.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Deployment**: Vercel or Netlify for hosting and deployment.

## Key Components

1. **Entry Point**: The application starts from `src/main.tsx`, which renders the main `App` component.
2. **Routing**: The routing logic is centralized in `src/routes/index.tsx`, allowing for easy management of application routes.
3. **Reusable Components**: All reusable components are exported from `src/components/index.ts`, promoting modularity.
4. **Utilities**: Utility functions are organized in `src/lib/index.ts`, making them easily accessible throughout the application.
5. **Global Styles**: Global CSS styles are defined in `src/styles/global.css`, ensuring consistent styling across the application.

## Deployment and CI/CD

The project includes CI/CD configurations in the `.github/workflows` directory, ensuring automated testing and deployment processes. The `ci.yml` file defines the steps for building and testing the application, while `codeql.yml` provides security scanning capabilities.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is provided in the `docs` directory, covering architecture, operational instructions, security practices, and buyer information. This documentation is crucial for onboarding new developers and for potential buyers during due diligence.

## Conclusion

The `enterprise-web-app` project is designed with scalability, maintainability, and security in mind. The architecture supports a robust development workflow, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.
