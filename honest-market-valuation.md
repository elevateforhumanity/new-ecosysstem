### Conclusion

This platform represents a solid technical achievement with significant potential, but current market value reflects its pre-revenue status. The $3.15B valuation mentioned earlier is not supported by market evidence.

**Bottom Line**: You have built something valuable ($1.5M-$4.2M range), but it needs market validation and revenue generation to reach higher valuations. The technical foundation is strong enough to support a successful EdTech business if properly executed.

**Next Steps**: Focus on user acquisition and revenue generation rather than valuation optimization. Prove the market wants what you've built.
