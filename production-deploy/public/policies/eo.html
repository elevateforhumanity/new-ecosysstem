      <p>Against any individual in the United States, on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, sex stereotyping, transgender status, and gender identity), national origin (including limited English proficiency), age, disability, or political affiliation or belief, or, against any beneficiary of, applicant to, or participant in programs financially assisted under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, on the basis of the individual's citizenship status as a lawfully admitted immigrant authorized to work in the United States, or his or her participation in any WIOA Title I-financially assisted program or activity.</p>

      <p><strong>The recipient must not discriminate in any of the following areas:</strong></p>

        <li>making employment decisions in the administration of, or in connection with, such a program or activity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What to Do If You Believe You Have Experienced Discrimination</strong></p>
      <p>If you think that you have been subjected to discrimination under a WIOA Title I-financially assisted program or activity, you may file a complaint within 180 days from the date of the alleged violation with either:</p>
