    <h1>Priority of Service for Veterans and Eligible Spouses</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>What is Priority of Service?</h2>
      <p>Priority of service means that covered persons receive priority over non-covered persons for the receipt of employment, training, and placement services provided under qualified job training programs. This priority applies to all services funded in whole or in part by the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
