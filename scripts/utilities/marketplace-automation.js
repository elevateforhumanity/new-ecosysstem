        **Lessons Learned:**
        - Federal partnerships = goldmine but slow to build
        - Automation is everything in education
        - Multiple revenue streams reduce risk
        - Social impact businesses get more support

        **The Exit:**
        Looking for $15K-25K for the complete package. Includes code, partnerships, support, training.

        Anyone interested in buying or want to know more about the build process?
